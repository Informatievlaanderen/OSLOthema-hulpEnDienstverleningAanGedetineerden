# Notes

## Aanbod

Considered classes:

- http://purl.org/vocab/cpsv#PublicService
  - Definition: This class represents the service itself. A public service is the capacity to carry out a procedure and 
    exists whether it is used or not. 
    It is a set of deeds and acts performed by or on behalf of a public agency for the benefit of 
    a citizen, a business or another public agency.
  - This can only be used when "Aanbod" is considered public service.
  - The definition does not include non-citizens, while prisons might have non-citizens.
  - If we use it, I think that we should subclass it instead of saying that "Aanbod" is of the class PublicService.
- https://schema.org/Service
  - Definition: A service provided by an organization, e.g. delivery service, print services, etc.
  - Reusable properties:
    - schema:audience for "Doelgroep"
- https://schema.org/Offer
  - Definition: An offer to transfer some rights to an item or to provide a service â€” 
    for example, an offer to sell tickets to an event, to rent the DVD of a movie, to stream a TV show over the internet, 
    to repair a motorcycle, or to loan a book.
- https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q161837
  - Definition: service provided by a government to people living within its jurisdiction
  - Can we consider an "Aanbod" to be provided by the government?
